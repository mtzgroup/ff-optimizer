This demo was originally used in a Martinez group meeting in 2024. 

It uses slurm to run the QM calculations. You may need to alter 
2_sampling/sbatch_template.sh to load the appropriate version of 
TeraChem. There are more instructions within the comments in that 
file. 

This example was produced using the setup function of ff-opt, and 
won't function correctly unless you re-do the setup step yourself
or alter the paths of the directories in input.yaml. Check the setup 
example if you want to see how to use the setup command. 

Therefore,it does not perform initial training; the optimization begins
with the MM sampling step. In such cases, dynamicsdir is the same folder 
as input.yaml, the "conformers" file that every MM sampling trajectory
begins from is butadiene.xyz. Changing the random seed and using a 
thermostat is enough to produce different trajectories. 

To run ff-opt:
  1. Activate a poetry shell with `poetry shell`
  2. Load an amber module compiled with the correct python version (currently 3.11+)
  3. Run `ff-opt optimize input.yaml`
