This demo shows how to use OpenMM for the MD sampling step. Note 
that the name of the train and valid md.in files is set to md.py
in the input file. In 2_sampling, you can find an example python
script to run the sampling step and extra instructions on how to
construct such a python script. 

To run ff-opt:
  1. Activate a poetry shell with `poetry shell`
  2. Load an amber module compiled with the correct python version (currently 3.11+)
  3. Run `ff-opt optimize input.yaml`
